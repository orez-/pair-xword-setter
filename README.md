# Pair-XWord Setter

A purpose-built crossword setting tool.
Used for building a crossword where each cell fills with a 2-letter rebus.

The word list is a slightly modified version of [Crossword-Nexus/collaborative-word-list](https://github.com/Crossword-Nexus/collaborative-word-list).

## Running Locally

I think svelte requires [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to compile, and I'm very sorry for that.

```shell
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```
